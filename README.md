# YouTube Transcript Search - Chrome Extension

A Chrome extension that permanently displays YouTube video transcripts in the sidebar, with search functionality and the ability to copy the complete text.

## What does this extension do?

This extension does practically the same thing as YouTube's native transcription tool, **but with two major differences:**

1. **Always visible**: The transcript stays visible in the sidebar while you watch the video, you don't have to constantly open and close the panel.

2. **You can copy the text**: It includes a "Copy All" button that copies the entire transcript to the clipboard with a single click.

## Additional features

- 🔍 **Real-time search**: Search for words or phrases within the transcript
- ⏱️ **Clickable timestamps**: Click on any line to jump to that moment in the video
- 🌓 **Adapts to theme**: Works in YouTube's light and dark mode
- 🌐 **Multiple languages**: If the video has subtitles in multiple languages, you can switch between them
